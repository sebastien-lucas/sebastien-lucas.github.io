** Introduction

My PhD focuses on the interaction of light with both ordered and disordered atomic lattices, mainly in 2D,
with the focus on large and dense, “mesoscopic” ensembles of cold atoms. The particularity of the mesoscopic
 regime is that the medium is not yet dense enough to be considered continuous but is already sufficiently dense
 for single-atom considerations to become inadequate. This work is directed by Dr. [[https://lpmmc.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article181][Sergey Skipetrov]] 
 and Dr. [[https://majulab.cnrs.fr/christian-miniatura-personal-page/][Christian Miniatura]] at the Laboratory 
 of Physics and Modelization of Condensed Media ([[https://lpmmc.cnrs.fr/][LPMMC]]) of CNRS, Grenoble, France. 
 Our approach is both numerical and analytical, and relevant for an experimental realization in 
 Pr. [[https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/David-Wilkowski][David Wilkowski]]’s lab at Nanyang Technological 
 University, Singapore.
